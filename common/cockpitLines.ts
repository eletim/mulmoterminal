// How many lines each row of the cockpit roster (the list beside a zoomed terminal) shows before
// it clamps. The roster trades two things against each other: how many sessions fit on screen,
// and how much of each one you can read without opening it. 2/2/3 is the tight end — it fits a
// long roster, but a summary written as a full sentence gets cut mid-thought, which is exactly
// when you wanted to read it. That is a trade the user should get to make, not a bug to fix, so
// the defaults stay put and the knob is opt-in.
//
// One knob per field: the three are worth different amounts. A summary says what a session is
// doing NOW, while a prompt is usually done in two lines.
//
// Shared because both sides decide from it: the server sanitizes and serves it, the grid renders
// from it. The CSS that applies the clamp is NOT here — the server has no use for it (#877).
